# Mission Vision Values Analysis: A Word Cloud for CORE

A project wherein my colleague and I do a sentiment analysis of the comments and notes on the Cook County Juvenile Court's new Mission, Vision, and Values statement (MVV.)

## MISSION:  
- To keep all court-involved children in the community, where they can receive equitable, focused, individualized intervention and opportunities to prevent further system involvement and harm. 

## VISION:
- All children are protected, valued, and supported within their communities not criminalized, punished, or incarcerated for societal failings. Children do not have to be subjected to system involvement to access resources.

## VALUES: 
### Accountability 
- We will support each other through mistakes, uplift successes and model authenticity, resiliency, creativity, collaboration, and consistent communication. 

### Community:  
- We value all children’s right to thrive in their own community. Our department will focus on youth remaining in their home community, being involved in policy, program, procedure decisions.  Additionally, the youth/family/community is a partner in harm reduction, healing and accountability decisions/work.   

### Compassion:  
- We will center the needs and experiences of children and families and approach their work with care and understanding.
- We will be attentive, curious, and empathic in our approaches, interactions, decision making and documentation and intentional in supporting growth and resilience. 

### Equity 
- All children regardless of age, race and gender will receive fair and equitable individualized care and attention.   

### Growth & Development  
- We are invested in each other’s personal and professional growth, will discard old ways of thinking that no longer serve our mission and incorporate new information that allows us to achieve best practices. 

### Healing:  
- We recognize that everyone’s healing journey is unique. Youth, families and communities involved with probation will define what healing means for them.
 
### Humanity:
- We value all children/familes as whole people, deserving of love, compassion and kindness, regardless of the circumstances that resulted in their court involvement.  

### Optimism: 
- We are hopeful and confident in the successful outcome for all children without exception.  

### Relationships: 
- We understand the importance of building connections with each other, children and families.
